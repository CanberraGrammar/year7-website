==== Term 2 App Design (In Class Task)

Working in groups of 2 or 3, your task is to design and create a Thunkable App to help solve a real world problem.

You may also choose to create a 1-2 minute video pitching the benefits of your app, similar to a presentation on Shark Tank.

Here are some ideas for you to consider:

* Things youâ€™d like to improve in your school or community (e.g. wellbeing, co-curricular activities, safety)
* A task in everyday life that could be more completed more easily (e.g. self-organisation, study planning, remembering chores)
* A cause that you feel strongly about (e.g. charity, medical research)
